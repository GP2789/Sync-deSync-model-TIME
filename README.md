# Sync-deSync-model-TIME

This repository contains all the code for the Sync-deSync model, TIME variant.

The model is contained in 4 parts. Code and parameters are consistent across model parts, but each 
implements either a portion of the total STDP function, or simulates a different paradigm.

For the model that simulates single cell theta-dependent plasticity, extract HL_model.zip;

For the model that simulates theta-induced memory effects in humans:
For model containing both spike-timing & theta-dependent plasticity, extract full_model.zip;
For model containing just spike-timing dependent plasticity, extract STDP_model.zip;
For model containing just theta-dependent plasticity, extract theta_model.zip;
